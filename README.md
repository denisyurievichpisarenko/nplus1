# nplus1

Every article at the popular-science news site nplus1.ru is ranked for its difficulty, where the most simple to understand ones are ranked close to 1, while the most complex ones can reach thhe values up to 9.

In this project, I am going to check if it is possible to predict the difficulty of the article using BERT Multilingual based solely on raw text (i.e. without other meta features we can obtain from the article, like topic or author).

The repo contains two notebooks: the main one and the crawler.
